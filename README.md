# guess_the_number
Guess the number: You vs PC!
A simple game where you can try to guess the number and win against the computer. You have 10 attempts.
The computer can't submit the same number twise. It generates a new number which exclude all the numbers that are already submitted.
The winner is the one who'll guess the right number first! If you both guess the number at the same time you'll share the first place!
Good luck!
