# Guess the number: You vs PC!
A simple game where you can try to guess the number and win against the computer. 
- You have 10 attempts.
- The computer can't submit the same number twice, but you can, so be watchful.
- When trying to guess, the computer generates a new number which excludes all the previous numbers that was already submitted from both parties.
- The winner is the one who'll guess the right number first! If you both guess the number at the same time, you'll share the first place!

Good luck! âœŒ
