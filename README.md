Guess a number: You vs PC!
A simple game where you can try to guess a number and win against the computer.
The computer can't submit the same number twise. It generates a new number which exclude all the numbers that are already submitted.
The winner is the one who'll guess the right number first! If you both guess the number at the same time you'll share the first place!
Good luck!
